        <p>SYRACUSE, N.Y. – This year’s hurricane season was the deadliest since 2005, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/30/2024-atlantic-hurricane-season-ends-with-at-least-335-us-deaths/76619181007/#:~:text=The%20great%2Dgreat%2Dgreat%20grandmother,on%20Saturday%2C%20Nov.%2030." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> killing at least 335 people</a>. Category four <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ilm/Helene2024"> Hurricane Helene </a> was notable for the chaos caused in North Carolina, and it’s ranking as the <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/12/the-weirdly-hyperactive-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season-ends/"> 4th deadliest U.S. hurricane in history</a>. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-helene-florida-557c5c512135e0a8661b298e45e17c92"> Hurricane Milton </a> continued to hit the many already devastated areas as a category five. This destruction stems from the high frequency era we are currently in but may also point to larger climate concerns. </p>

        <p>The official hurricane season is from June 1st to November 30th, which captures about 95% relativity – a majority of the storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has collected data on hurricanes during this time from 1851-2023, essential for tracking the frequency and quantity of hurricanes that can impact the United States, and overall North Atlantic. While data for the earlier centuries is still being discovered and updated, satellite technology has helped ensure the accuracy of the data for the 20th and 21st centuries. These numbers reveal there are a few key trends to watch for regarding increasing frequency and power of hurricanes over the last couple of decades; important factors to consider, especially in more destructive eras.</p>

        <p>High frequency eras are attributed to the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). The AMO has periods that last around 20-40 years in warm and cool phases. Atmospheric conditions such as “warmer sea surface temperatures, increased thunderstorm activity, and drastic changes in wind speed and direction” promote storms in the Atlantic during the warm phases, according to <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/stories/atlantic-high-activity-eras-what-does-it-mean-for-hurricane-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOAA</a>. More hurricanes overall correlate with more storms that make landfall, where heavy rainfall and high winds cause devastating impacts. This year's total surpassed the average of two, <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/atlantic-hurricane-season-races-to-finish-within-range-of-predicted-number-of-named-storms#:~:text=The%20Atlantic%20basin%20saw%2018,making%20landfall%20as%20major%20hurricanes.">  with five making landfall</a>.</p>

           <iframe title="Hurricanes from 2003-2023 - NOAA" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-YXtMm" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YXtMm/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="438" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
            </p>

        <p>The high frequency era can also lead to more major hurricanes. Major hurricanes are hurricanes with a Saffir-Simpson Scale of three or more. Over the past couple of centuries, the most that have ever occurred in one year has been seven. The most recent year was 2020, with the other year being 2005, showing a recency in this trend. This year’s season again surpassed the average with five major hurricanes.</p>

        <p>“You have more of a higher percentage of your storms become hurricanes, become major hurricanes," said <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/CTB/management.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Rosencrans</a>, Climate Testbed Director at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. "So, they contribute more ace, they follow the pattern of during La Nina years, or even non-El Nino years, you have more hurricane and storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and then kind of the western Atlantic."</p>

        <p>Likewise, there has been an increase in general frequency over the last few decades. For instance, there were 1.3 times more hurricanes from 2003-2023 compared to 1982-2002. Even more, <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/atlantic-hurricane-season-races-to-finish-within-range-of-predicted-number-of-named-storms#:~:text=The%20Atlantic%20basin%20saw%2018,making%20landfall%20as%20major%20hurricanes." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 11 out of the 18 named storms </a> this year were hurricanes. A very hyperactive year, according to Rosencrans.</p>

        <p>But, Rosencrans acknowledged that this doesn’t necessarily explain why there have consistently been more major hurricanes since 2016 than the previous fifty years. While a general trend may be attributed to the high frequency era, and the lack of satellites and instruments indicates there could have been more major hurricanes earlier on, the 2016 instance is phenomena scientists are still figuring out.</p>

        <p>“There's other factors in that, for sure, because just looking at like the numbers of storms since then, that's one thing, but the fact that so many have been strong and been in the western half of the Caribbean or Western Lake to even make landfall less so, it does imply that there's some kind of circulation pattern that has changed a bit,” said Rosencrans.</p>

        <p><iframe title="Increasing Strength (ACE) in Hurricanes with a five-year average" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ens9o" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ens9o/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="482" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
        </p>

        <p>As such, frequency isn’t the only factor to keep an eye on. Another trend to look for is the strength calculated in ACE, or Accumulated Cyclone Energy, of these storms. Data reveals that the ACE is 1.5 times more for the previous 21 years compared to the 21 years before that. This indicates an increase in energy of the hurricanes and storms that have been documented for the last few decades. In the past decade, there has also been an almost 300% increase in the total (revised) ACE for hurricanes. This indicates that storms have gotten significantly stronger within the past decade. However, there has been a 20% decrease compared to 2003, indicating patterns can fluctuate over the decades.</p>

        <p>“Despite these large year-to-year fluctuations, future changes in the interannual variability of hurricane activity are rarely investigated in detail, resulting in significant uncertainty in future projections and impacts,” said <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/people/hosmay-lopez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hosmay Lopez</a>, a NOAA oceanographer in an article by <a href="https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2024/11/26/269026.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Carrier Management</a>. “Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand not only the mean activity changes but also the interannual variability changes.” </p>
    
        <p> Overall, there is a 5% percent change in the average ACE for the past 21 years (including 2023) and the average ACE for 2023. From this, 2023 hurricanes had more power than the average hurricane of the last couple decades, indicating an increase in destructive capabilities. Situated with a five-year average, the overall strength has continued to rise each decade.</p>
        
        <p>It is clear that these massive storms do not only affect the coast. Moreover, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/business/economy/hurricane-helene-deaths-climate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The New York Times</a>, the deaths will continue for years after, so it is important to analyze the previous years to try and predict the impact of upcoming years. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07945-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Nature</a> also recently published a study on this, reporting thousands of additional deaths up to 15 years after the events. Understanding the trends of climate is imperative to prepare for the coming years. The rate that hurricanes are occurring since 2016 needs to be watched, and the implications after hurricanes tracked, to prepare for what could be a unique climate pattern.</p>
